My name is Ana Baez, I'm a data
scientist in the Data Intelligence team.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.519
I work on basically bringing in all the
trial data sets that we use for our

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.080
research teams, going through them, analysing them and

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.160
then identifying which ones are
viable to be tested, and delivering them

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.960
to the relevant teams.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.320
I heard about G-Research through word-of-mouth, other students

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.840
at UCL had mentioned it at some point. I
recognised the brand,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.199
I saw an opportunity arise in their
engineering department,

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.120
and I applied, and the rest of history.
Yeah I definitely would describe the culture

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.879
of G-Research as one of meritocracy.
It's not about whoever screams the

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.040
loudest but rather, having good ideas that are

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.520
evidence-backed and being able to
engage in a healthy level of of debate

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.719
and discussion and then proceed with
what is perceived to be the best way

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.800
forward. It's very candid and it's very

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.120
transparent in a lot of ways.
There's a real emphasis on people

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.960
socialising and communicating with each
other,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.719
so the last Thursday of every month there'll be beers and snacks and

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.320
wine available and everyone from
all over the company

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.159
come and meet and interact. You
also have

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.960
a lot of sports-related social clubs so
there's a basketball group I play every Monday

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.960
there's football, there's yoga, and
climbing, and more. Those are the ones

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.400
that I know best. So many great ideas came from something

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.759
that's very simple at the core and it's
about observing and then using that

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.040
observation to make models and to make

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.040
decisions.
