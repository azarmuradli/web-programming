My name is Ana Baez, I'm a data scientist in the Data Intelligence team.

I work on basically bringing in all the trial data sets that we use for our

research teams, going through them, analysing them and

then identifying which ones are viable to be tested, and delivering them

to the relevant teams.

I heard about G-Research through word-of-mouth, other students

at UCL had mentioned it at some point. I recognised the brand,

I saw an opportunity arise in their engineering department,

and I applied, and the rest of history. Yeah I definitely would describe the culture

of G-Research as one of meritocracy. It's not about whoever screams the

loudest but rather, having good ideas that are

evidence-backed and being able to engage in a healthy level of of debate

and discussion and then proceed with what is perceived to be the best way

forward. It's very candid and it's very

transparent in a lot of ways. There's a real emphasis on people

socialising and communicating with each other,

so the last Thursday of every month there'll be beers and snacks and

wine available and everyone from all over the company

come and meet and interact. You also have

a lot of sports-related social clubs so there's a basketball group I play every Monday

there's football, there's yoga, and climbing, and more. Those are the ones

that I know best. So many great ideas came from something

that's very simple at the core and it's about observing and then using that

observation to make models and to make

decisions.
